# Week 4 Lab Notebook

## Who am I? Page Description

While creating the Who am I? page, I was trying to put as much information about be as I could so that people reading my page could get to know me better.

### Problems:

<style>
  .bullet-points {
    list-style-type: disc; 
    margin-left: 40px; 
  }
  .bullet-points li {
    margin-bottom: 20px; 
  }
</style>

<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>I had some trouble creating the table that displayed my classes because I wasn't 100% sure how to make it</li>
</ul>

### Solution:

<style>
  .bullet-points {
    list-style-type: disc; 
    margin-left: 40px; 
  }
</style>

<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>After reading slack announcements, I saw that Mr. Mortensen had sent out an announcement that showed us how to create the tables. I used this information to create the table that is not on my home page</li>
</ul>

### Skills used/learned:

<style>
  .bullet-points {
    list-style-type: disc; 
    margin-left: 40px; 
  }
</style>

<ul class = "bullet-points">
  <li>I learned the HTML language a little better because I understood how different lines could be made to make a table using just a few lines of code</li>
</ul>
