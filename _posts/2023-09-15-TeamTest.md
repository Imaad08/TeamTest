## Tester function

First import that math module to take square roots

```python
import math
```

Create a function that takes a square root of a number. However, there is an error where the code doesn't know what to do if the number is negative as square roots of negative numbers are not real and it can cause issues.

```python
def calculate_square_root(num):
    return math.sqrt(num)
```

Start debugging the function with try, except, if, and else. Then give the function two numbers. One negative and one positive. The negative will print an error but the positive will print a real number

```python
def test_calculate_square_root(num):
    try:
        if num < 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot calculate square root for a negative number")
        else:
            print(f"The square root of {num} is: {math.sqrt(num)}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


# Test and debug function
test_calculate_square_root(-9)
test_calculate_square_root(25)
```

Correct the function to explain the error

```python
def calculate_square_root(num):
    try:
        if num < 0:
            raise ValueError(f"Cannot calculate square root for {num} as it is a negative number.")
        else:
            print(f"The square root of {num} is: {math.sqrt(num)}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"{e}")
        return None

# Test the final function
calculate_square_root(-9)
calculate_square_root(25)
```
